    title: "Robotics revolution in surgery – from innovation to micro-robotics",
    doi: "",
    abstract:
      "Robotics is multi-disciplinary field which focusses on providing automation to vast sectors or industries. Automation leads to increased productivity by reducing the dependence on humanity, i.e., robots share workspace with humans to assist them in every possible sense. Since the onset of “Industry 4.0”, robotics has made its roots in many industries, ranging for performing “Material Handling”, “Processing” & “Assembly” applications in manufacturing industries to even “Surgeries” in Medical sector. Notably, robotics in healthcare extends beyond traditional laparoscopic surgery, with innovations like 3D ergonomic robot surgeons for procedures such as Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), Endoscopy Robotics and Cranial Neuro-Surgery.",

    title: "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Early Diagnosis of Cancer",
    doi: "",
    abstract:
      "Cancer is oncogenic transformation of cells stimulated by carcinogens which stops contact inhibition that leads to tumors (benign or malign). As per World Health Organization (WHO), 10 million people died in 2020 due to cancer, most prominently by lung cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer and breast cancer. Nearly, 50% cancer patients die due to late diagnosis. Current diagnostic techniques include biopsy and histopathology of tissues, radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some treatment techniques include chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and surgery. Although medical sector have these techniques, cancer at higher stages is still incurable, therefore late detection of cancer is fatal. With the onset of Industry 4.0, the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been established. AI can be used to speed up the process of medical diagnosis, for example, convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect cancer based on medical report of the patient (X-ray, CT scan or MRI scan.",

      "A scientific review on the emerging trends of robotics and surgical robotics in the Industry 4.0",
    doi: "",
    abstract:
      "Purpose – This study aims to analyze the role of robotics in healthcare and surgeries. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the challenges, advancements and future prospects in the field of surgical robotics in accordance with the “Industry 4.0”. Robotics has made its roots in many industries, ranging for performing “Material Handling”, “Processing” & “Assembly” applications in manufacturing industries to even “Surgeries” in Medical sector, which is addressed in this paper along with the limitations associated with them. Design/Methodology/Approach – a comprehensive literature review was conducted to summarize the current state of research on surgical robotics. The search includes articles from the databases such as World Journal of Engineering (Emerald Publishing Ltd), IEEE Xplore, PubMed, ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Studies were assessed for quality and relevance, ensuring proper citation of the relevant references of relevant authors. Findings – Notably, robotics in healthcare extends beyond traditional laparoscopic surgery, with innovations like 3D ergonomic robot surgeons for procedures such as Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), Endoscopy Robotics and Cranial Neuro-Surgery. Out of the various methodologies of robotics adopted by surgeons, “da Vinci system” is said to be one of the best and foundational approach of robots in surgery, based on which many systems were inspired and built.",

      "Comparative analysis of different types of CNN methodologies for prediction of Rice Blast Disease",
    doi: "",
    abstract:
      "Rice is a staple crop in India, consumed by millions daily, and a significant contributor to the nation’s global agricultural trade. Despite being a leading producer and exporter, challenges like plant diseases hinder rice productivity, leading to yield losses. While traditional chemical methods and organic solutions have been employed to combat these diseases, they often fall short in meeting rising demands. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present innovative solutions, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) being particularly effective. This study employs CNNs with transfer learning methodologies to predict rice blast disease on a public dataset consisting of 5490 images. Data augmentation was incorporated into training dataset to enhance its quality and avoid overfitting. The transfer learning methodologies include MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2 and InceptionResNetV2. After training, the validation accuracies of these three models were found to be 87.2165, 86.7010 & 82.9896, respectively. MobileNetV2 architecture demonstrated superior performance, so it was used for further training with processed dataset, achieving 91.86% validation accuracy and 89.84% testing accuracy (on manually passed test data). We have employed two novel techniques to eliminate false predictions and further avoiding overfitting, i.e., usage of an invalid class other than rice blast and healthy classes and usage of confidence threshold on model’s prediction. Finally, a web application was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask and Jinja2 for deployment of the final CNN model. This research contributes to building smart agricultural systems, reducing dependence on less efficient disease management techniques, and promoting sustainable practices.",
